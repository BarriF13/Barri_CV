## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a passionate software developer with the background in graphic design. I used to design websites with Adobe dreamweaver and CMS platform such as wordpress and wix but I became frustrated with the restrictions of the the platforms and started to look into how to write my own custom code.

As soon as I started learning to code I found myself excited and obsessed with it, so after 7 months of self learning code , I decided to join MakersAcademy to improve my challenges and knowledge.
Now creating apps, debugging, finding solutions and stylings are my new tools.

### **B design studio** (2004 - today)

#### *Freelance graphic/web designer*
Form the day I stepped in the university till today I am working as a freelance designer. I've been approached by different type of clients such as freelancers , small or big businesses.

Mostly needed new identity and brand design.  After that step,  I have always point them to the importance of the digital products and its presents in the cyber world.
As their designer and semi developer , I had to make sure that their digital products are up and running and tick certain boxes of the latest trend inthe industry, for example  on their website :
- Being Responsive , fast loading , optimized for search engine  and etc.

- Tested for the best possible user experience

- Designed with high quality of user interface standarts

- All product - print or digital- follow the same branding (protocols ? prototype?)

Also as a freelancer I was always chanllenged to :
- work with limited budgets for individual or freelance clients and still deliver market standard quality products.
- Co-oporate with different teams such as photographers , and make sure we are following the same goals. 
- Finding smart solutions for any technical or financial obstacle. 
  

### **Lorca Digital Photography Studio** (2000 - 2003)

#### *web/graphic designer  ( in house)*

Working for one of the biggest photography studio as a junior designer helped me to achieve :
- Learn how to work within a big team for the same goal
- Manage my own reponsibilities , work under pressure and meet deadlines 
- Achieve set design skills and help photographers to produce better visual products
- Talking to clients when the senior designer weren't available
- Branding and producing print materials
- Producing high quality digital photoes
-  Helping other designers to convert their print products to digital as they didn't know the technology then

### **HV Substations Development Co.** (2000 - 2003)

#### *In house part time Web designer*

My first role as a web designer, working side by side with a web developer, I learnt about HTML, CSS, Javascript. Our approched to webdesign was very simple compare to now. I used to design the pages fully in photoshop.
Now that I look back I can see, I insticaly was designing on UX/UI bases by implying these points :
- How users going to feel when they approch the site 
-  What messages we like to deliver to the them
- Is it easy for them to access the information they are looking for
- What about accessibility
and many more.
