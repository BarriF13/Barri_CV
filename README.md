## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a passionate software developer with a background in graphic design. I have experience designing websites with Adobe Dreamweaver and CMS platforms such as Wordpress and Wix. After mastering the basics, I then started learning to code to over come the restrictions of the platforms.

As soon as I started learning to code I found myself excited and engaged with it. So after 7 months of teaching myself to code , I decided to join Makers Academy to improve my knowledge and challenge myself.
Now creating apps, debugging, finding solutions and stylings are my new tools.

### **B design studio** (2004 - present)

#### *Freelance graphic/web designer*
Since University I have worked as a freelance designer. I've been selected to do projects for different type of clients such as freelancers and businesses of various sizes.

For each I have helped improved their identity and brand design. I have also always highlighted to them the importance of the digital products and its presence in the cyber world.

As their designer and digital adviser, I had to make sure their digital products are up and running and are inline with the latest trends in the industry, for example  on their website :
- Being responsive , fast loading , optimized for search engine, etc.

- Tested for the best possible user experience

- Designed with high quality of user interface standards

- All product - print or digital- follow the same branding prototype

Also as a freelancer I was always challenged to :
- work with limited budgets for individual or freelance clients and still deliver market standard quality products.
- Co-operate with different teams such as photographers , and making sure we are following the same goals. 
- Finding smart solutions for any technical or financial obstacle. 
  

### **Lorca Digital Photography Studio** (2000 - 2003)

#### *web/graphic designer  ( in house)*

Working for one of the biggest photography studio as a junior designer helped me:
- Learn how to work within a big team towards the same goal
- Manage my own responsibilities , work under pressure and meet deadlines 
- Achieve set design skills and help photographers to produce better visual products
- Talking to clients when the senior designers weren't available
- Branding and producing print materials
- Producing high quality digital photos
- Helping other designers to convert their print products to digital format
### **HV Substations Development Co.** (2000 - 2003)

#### *In house part time Web designer*

In my first role as a web designer, working side by side with a web developer, I learnt about HTML, CSS, Javascript. Our approach to web design was very simple compared to now.
I showed sensitivity when designing on UX/UI bases by addressing these points :
- How users feel when they approach the site 
- What messages we deliver to them
- How easy it is for them to access the information they are looking for
- Issues around accessibility
and many more.
