## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a full stack software developer, passionate for Front-end development with a background in graphic design. 

I have experience designing websites with Adobe Dreamweaver and CMS platforms such as WordPress and Wix. After mastering the basics, I then started learning to code to overcome the restrictions of the platforms.

As soon as I started learning to code I found myself excited and engaged with it. So after 7 months of teaching myself to code, I decided to join Makers Academy to improve my knowledge and challenge myself. Now creating apps, debugging, finding solutions and stylings are my new tools.

## <a name="experience">Experience</a>

  

### **B design studio** (2004 - present)

#### *Freelance graphic/web designer*
Since University I have worked as a freelance designer. I've been selected to do projects for different types of clients such as freelancers and businesses of various sizes.
For each, I have helped improve their identity and brand design. I have also always highlighted to them the importance of digital products and their presence in the cyber world.
As their designer and digital adviser, I had to make sure their digital products are up and running and are in line with the latest trends in the industry, for example on their website :
- Being responsive, fast loading, optimized for search engines, etc.

- Tested for the best possible user experience.

- Designed with high quality of user interface standards.

- All product - print or digital- follow the same branding prototype.

Also as a freelancer, I was always challenged to :
- work with limited budgets for individual or freelance clients and still deliver market standard quality products.
- Co-operate with different teams such as photographers, and making sure we are following the same goals.
- Finding smart solutions for any technical or financial obstacle.
  

### **Lorca Digital Photography Studio** (2000 - 2003)

#### *web/graphic designer  ( in house)*

Working for one of the biggest photography studios as a junior designer helped me:
- Learn how to work within a big team towards the same goal
- Manage my responsibilities, work under pressure and meet deadlines 
- Achieve set design skills and help photographers to produce better visual products
- Talking to clients when the senior designers weren't available
- Branding and producing print materials
- Producing high-quality digital photos
- Helping other designers to convert their print products to digital format
### **HV Substations Development Co.** (2000 - 2003)

#### *In house part-time Web designer*

In my first role as a web designer, working side by side with a web developer, I learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript. Our approach to web design was very simple compared to now. I showed sensitivity when designing on UX/UI bases by addressing these points :
- How users feel when they approach the site.
- What messages we deliver to them.
- How easy it is for them to access the information they are looking for.
- Issues around accessibility and many more.
